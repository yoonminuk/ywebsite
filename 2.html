  we were delighted to discover that the Web Fonts Working Group, along with MPEG, will be honored for standardizing font technology for custom downloadable fonts and typography for web and TV devices.
This award represents the culmination of a quarter-century of work at W3C. Web Fonts enable people to use fonts on demand over the web without requiring installation in the operating system. W3C has experience in downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2, and SVG. Downloadable fonts were not common on the web due to the lack of an interoperable font format. The Web Fonts effort addresses that through the creation of an industry-supported, open font format for the web called “WOFF” (Web Open Font Format) whose version 2, which became a standard in 2018, is deployed in all major web browsers and powers a vast majority of sites.
This is the third Emmy® Award in Technical & Engineering W3C has won. We will be working with our colleagues to send delegates to the ceremony that will be part of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) show in Las Vegas on April 25, 2022.
The Technology & Engineering Emmy® Awards are awarded to a living individual, a company, or a scientific or technical organization for developments and/or standardization involved in engineering technologies that either represent so extensive an improvement on existing methods or are so innovative in nature that they materially have affected television.
